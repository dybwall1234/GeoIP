Description: This package allows one to map a computer's IP address
 to a country, and with the appropriate (free) database,
 obtain the longitude and latitude, city name, phone code for the area,
 etc. This is done by interfacing to the MaxMinds GeoIP database
 via their C API. The code for this package is autogenerated
 using RGCCTranslationUnit and the run-time bindings provided by
 the Rffi package.
